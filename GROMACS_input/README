Input files with parameters for preparation of and running the molecular dynamics simulations with GROMACS. 
ions.mdp places ions using steepest descent optimization
minim.mdp minimizes the energy of the structure using steepest descent minimization
nvt.mdp contains the parameters for a simulation in the NVT ensemble where the protein is kept fixed. The system is heated to 310 K.
npt.mdp eqeuilibrates the system to T=310 K and P=1 bar.
The equilibration steps are doe using the V-scale thermostat und the Berendsen barostat with respective time constants of 0.1 and 2 ps.
