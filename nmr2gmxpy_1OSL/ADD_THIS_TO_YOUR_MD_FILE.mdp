; Created automaticaly for this topology: 1OSL/1OSL.top.
; Add what is written in this file to your .mdp file for including constraints
; in your MD calculations. Here are listed all the NMR parameters.
; We suggest to not change them unless you know what you do.

; NMR refinement stuff 
; Distance restraints type: No, Simple or Ensemble
disre                    = Simple
; Force weighting of pairs in one distance restraint: Conservative or Equal
disre-weighting          = Conservative
; Use sqrt of the time averaged times the instantaneous violation
disre-mixed              = no
disre-fc                 = 1000
disre-tau                = 0
; Output frequency for pair distances to energy file
nstdisreout              = 0

; Dihedral restraints do not required any parameters. It is enough to include them in topology.
