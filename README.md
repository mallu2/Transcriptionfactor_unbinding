# Transcriptionfactor_unbinding
This repository contains the starting structures and GROMACS input files to run molecular dynamics with NMR restraints on a complex between the transcriptionfactor LacI and different sequences of DNA.
It contains files that allow the usage of NMR restraints (PDB ID 1OSL) on a crystal structure of the same protein (PDB ID 1EFA). It also contains files that restraint the DNA ends and a bash script that can be modified to automate the preparation of the simulation.
