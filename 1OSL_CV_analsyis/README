1osl_C52V.pdb has been produced with PyMOL by mutating the two Cys52 back to Val52.
There is one mistake in mode 11 ILE48 in the PDB structure that has also been fixed in PyMOL.

To have at least equivalent atom names and order of atoms, the pdb file has been converted with GROMACS pdb2gmx:
gmx_mpi pdb2gmx -ignh -f 1osl_C52V_ILE11.pdb -o 1osl_C52V_GMX.pdb

The numbering in the files has the been changed, to have consecutive residue IDs that were equal for each mode.
The result from all the preperation steps is 1osl_C52V_GMX_new_numbering.pdb

1osl_C52V_GMX_new_numbering_f1.pdb contains the first frame as reference pdb file for PLUMED analysis.
